# Time Series Prediction using RNN

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to predict sequential/time-series data.  
RNNs are suitable for handling temporal dependencies where past values influence future outcomes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- TensorFlow / Keras  

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- Sequence generation for time-series modeling  
- RNN model building and training  
- Performance evaluation using loss metrics  
- Visualization of actual vs predicted values  

## 📊 Use Case
- Stock price prediction  
- Weather forecasting  
- Sales and demand forecasting  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `RNN.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. View predictions and visualizations  

## 📈 Output
The model predicts future values based on historical sequences and displays results graphically.

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of RNNs for sequence learning and time-series forecasting.
